# Docs Page Template

Use this template to keep pages consistent, scannable, and task-first.

## Required structure

1. `When to use this`
2. `Prerequisites`
3. `Happy path`
4. `Failure modes`
5. `Related pages`

## UX guardrails

- Keep at most 6 primary top-level sections per page.
- Include the first code sample in the first screenful when practical.
- Add an at-a-glance callout near the top on longer pages.
- Include at least 3 related links.
- Use semantic link text (task intent), not raw path labels.
- Avoid landing pages that primarily list backticked file paths.

## Content standards

- Prefer short paragraphs and decision-oriented subsections.
- Include one golden-path output expectation.
- Include at least one deterministic failure example where relevant.
- End guide/start pages with a “Next actions” block.
